# Boosting-Theory
A collection of papers produced on the theory of boosting as applied to binary classification. Further extensions to the multi-class classification problem and necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure boostability i.e. weak learning conditions. Finally, an overview over boosting algorithms and models employed in industry.
