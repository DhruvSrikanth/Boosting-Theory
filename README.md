# Boosting and Boostability: Weak Learning Implies Strong Learning

In this paper, we explore the design and analysis of boosting algorithms and the necessary and
sufficient conditions on the weak learners to ensure boostability. Following a literature survey on the
computational learning theory behind boosting, we explore boosting, boostability, and conditions
for both in several boosting algorithms. Finally, we discuss the application of such algorithms in
the binary classification problem and extensions to the multi-class problem.
